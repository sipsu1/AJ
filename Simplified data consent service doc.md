## General info

Architectural style: REST API

Data structure: JSON

Authentication: All queries sent to the Data Consent Service are checked to ensure that the x-tes authenticated subsystem accessing the Data Consent Service is the correct party to make the query. The Data Consent Service only responds to a query if the requester (i.e. the Data Collection or Client Application) is associated with the consent being checked, either through the subsystem specified in the purpose declaration or through the subsystem specified in the service declaration, which is always associated with the purpose declaration. Authentication is based on the metadata of the X-tee security server (client subsystem), which is compared with the specifications in the purpose declaration(s).

You have two days to add a document to the consent service and 24 hours, or one day, to sign the document.

Data types:
* String type parameters are UTF-8 encoded symbols.
* Number type parameters are ASCII code sequences in the range 47-57 (numbers 0-9).
* Timestamp type parameters are timestamps in ISO8601 format.

Web service URLs:
* LIVE:  https://<security-server-address>/r1/EE/GOV/70006317/consent/consent/...
* STAGE: https://<security-server-address>/r1/ee-dev/GOV/70006317/consent/consent-stage/...

Steps for simplified data request service.
The image is illustrative, showing what a simplified signing process might look like. The actual process depends on the business processes implemented in the specific institution.

## POST /api/consent/references
The query can be used to request consent references for valid consent(s) from the Data Consent Service.

API URL:  https://<security-server-address>/r1/ee-dev/GOV/70006317/consent/consent-stage/api/consent/reference 

**Input**
Parameter | Is it mandatory?| Data type | Description
------------ | ------------- | ------------ | -------------
idCode | yes | string | Personal identification code of the data subject.
purposeDeclarationBusinessIdentifiers | yes | array of strings | Declaration of objectives identifier (there may be several).


**Query example**
```json
{
  "idCode": "60001019906",
  "purposeDeclarationBusinessIdentifiers": [
    "EesmärgideklaratsiooniID",
    "ED_KAKS",
    "ED_KOLM"
  ]
}
```

When receiving a query, the Data Consent Service checks that the identifier of the x-tee subsystem of the x-tee authenticated Client Application is the same as that specified in the purpose declaration(s).

**Output**
Parameter | Data type | Description
------------ | ------------ | -------------
purposeDeclarationBusinessIdentifier (näidises: "ED_KAKS") | string | Only those declarations of intent for which valid consent has been found (status APPROVED) will be returned.
consentReference | string | Valid consent reference –  a unique code used to validate the validity of consent.

**Query example**
```json
{
  "ED_KAKS": "91e9844d-3b5e-4df8-9254-42316b1607b6"
}
```

## GET /api/consent/validation/client
The query can be used to ask the Data Consent Service about the validity of consent. When using the simplified data consent service, this service is optional and is used for validation. Upon receiving the query, the Data Consent Service checks that the x-tee authenticated Client Application x-tee subsystem identifier is the same as that specified in the consent-related purpose declaration.

API URL: https://<security-server-address>/r1/ee-dev/GOV/70006317/consent/consent-stage/api/consent/validation/client 

**Input**
Parameter | Is it mandatory? | Data type | Description
------------ | ------------- | ------------ | -------------
consentReference | yes | string | Consent reference – a unique code corresponding to the consent whose validity is to be validated.

**Query example**

`https://<turvaserveri-aadress>/r1/ee-dev/GOV/70006317/consent/consent-stage/api/consent/validation/client?consentReference=91e9844d-3b5e-4df8-9254-42316b1607b6`

**Output**
Parameter | Data type | Description
------------ | ------------ | -------------
consentReference | string | Consent reference – a unique code corresponding to the consent whose validity is being validated. 
consentExpiration | timestamp (ISO 8601) | End of consent validity period.
idCode | string | Personal identification code of the data subject.
purposeDeclarationId | string | Identifier of the consent-related purpose statement.

**Query example**
```json
{
  "consentReference": "91e9844d-3b5e-4df8-9254-42316b1607b6",
  "consentExpiration": "2022-01-22T23:59:59.999999Z",
  "idCode": "60001019906",
  "purposeDeclarationId": "ED_KAKS"
}
```

## POST /api/consent/third-party 
Using a query, the Client Application can ask the Data Consent Service to grant consent(s) that are missing from the consent request(s).

The Data Consent Service processes the incoming query and generates a consent request data set based on the combination of the personal identification code and the purpose statement provided in the input. If there are several purpose declarations in the input, a separate data set, i.e. consent request, is generated for each purpose declaration. Each consent request (consent pending decision) is assigned a unique UUID. The consent request data set contains the consent request metadata and a system-generated container containing the consent data compiled into a PDF file or only the PDF file. The client application signs the PDF file and returns the signed file to the Data Consent Service. 

API URL: https://<security-server-address>/r1/ee-dev/GOV/70006317/consent/consent-stage/api/consent/third-party 

**Input**
Parameter | Is it mandatory? | Data type | Description
------------ | ------------- | ------------ | -------------
idCode | yes | string | Personal identification code of the data subject.
purposeDeclarationBusinessIdentifiers | yes | array of String | Identifier of the statement of objectives. There can be several.
firstName | yes | string | First name of the data subject.
lastName | yes | string | The data subject's surname.
language | no | string | 	Language code that determines the language of the data. Two-letter codes are used (e.g., "en" for English, "et" for Estonian). The default value is "et". 

**Query example**
```json
{
  "idCode": "60001019906",
  "firstName": "Jaan",
  "lastName": "Tamm",
  "purposeDeclarationBusinessIdentifiers": [
    "ED_KAKS",
    "ED_KOLM"
  ]
}
```

**Output**

## POST /api/consent/third-party/container
The query can be used to send signed consent(s) to the Data Consent Service.

API URL: https://<security-server-address>/r1/ee-dev/GOV/70006317/consent/consent-stage/api/consent/third-party/container

**Checks and storage logic**

The data consent service processes the incoming query. During query processing, the data in the query is compared with the data in the database, where the following is checked:

- Whether the X-Road client that made the query matches the consent-related service declaration in the database.
- Whether the fields found in the database entry by UUID match the consent information.
- Whether the signed DigiDoc container and signature are valid.
- Whether the PDF hash in the DigiDoc container matches the PDF hash in the database container.
- Whether the signature has been given within the last hour (time period adjustable with system parameter allowedSignatureTimeInMinutes = 24 hours).
- Whether the personal data in the signature (personal identification code, first name, last name) matches the information in the database.
- If the data checks return a positive response ("status": "OK"), the data is saved in the following tables in the "Consent" database: CONSENT, CONSENT_SNAPSHOT, FILE. The unsigned DigiDoc container in the "FILE" table is replaced with the signed DigiDoc container from the query.
- In case of an error, the status is returned with an error code (see Query response).

**Input**
The query input consists of the UUID of the consent(s) and digitally signed DigiDoc container(s). The input consists of an array containing one or more signed consents. One consent consists of the consent UUID value and a signed digital container containing the consent file in pdf format.

Parameter | Is it mandatory? | Data type | Description
------------ | ------------- | ------------ | -------------
consentConfirmReference | yes | string | Consent UUID pending decision.
file | yes | string | Signed consent (DigiDoc container in ASICE format).  Base64-encoded file within the string. NB! The file name in the container is "Nousolek.pdf". The container only contains the consent PDF file; no other files are allowed in the container.

**Input**
```json
[{
 "consentConfirmReference": "7bf5904a-bce3-483f-99c2-527937b032b7",
 "file": "0gaXBzdW0gZG9sb3Igc2l0IGFtZXQsIGNvbnNlY3RldHVyIGFkaXBpc2Npbmcg"
}]
```

**Output**
The response to the query is an array containing a response for each consent regarding the success/failure of data processing. The array consists of the UUID value of the consent awaiting a decision, the status, and the errorCode value if data processing fails.

Parameter | Is it mandatory? | Data type | Description
------------ | ------------- | ------------ | -------------
consentConfirmReference | yes | string | Consent UUID pending decision.
status | yes | string | If the data processing is successful, the status "OK" is returned; If the data processing is unsuccessful, the status "ERROR" is returned, together with the corresponding errorCode value. 
errorCode | yes | string | 	
HTTP_NOT_FOUND - The X-road client is not the same as the one specified in the consent-related service declaration; CONSENT_VALIDATE_INVALID – The consent data provided in the input does not match the consent in the database. CONSENT_NOT_FOUND – The UUID provided in the input cannot be found in the database.

**Query example**
```json
[{
"consentConfirmReference": "7bf5904a-bce3-483f-99c2-527937b032b7",
"status": "OK"
}, {
"consentConfirmReference": "f16904d0-6f9c-44b4-96a6-ae2106ab326b",
"status": "ERROR",
"errorCode": "CONSENT_NOT_FOUND"
}]
```
